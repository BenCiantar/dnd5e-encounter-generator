<h3>Dungeons and Dragons 5e Encounter Generator</h3>

Brief: Part one of the individual project for the Hyper Island "First Web App" module. The brief was to rapibdly build a web app that incorporates an API, with the aim of later refactoring it into a React project.

Timeframe: One week.

Description: I chose to create a tool for Dungeons and Dragons game masters to easily generate and balance monster encounters for their players by automating the calculation tables included in the rulebook, and incorporating a DnD monster API.

    Rapid development of a web app.
    
    Incorporating a public API into my project.
    
    Using asynchronous functions to manage importing data.

    Handling complex logic and calculations.
                
    Reformatting API data to fit the nees of my project.
